# Live Class Project - 09
#### Sandbox Assignments by Hitesh Sir 


### Work Description :
The said project is a non-responsive sample work given by my mentor to practice in HTML & CSS.

This one in particular took me a while to balance the elements in place without breaking the flow of the page. 
 
"After this I am confident that I can build similar pages more efficiently and accurately & that too on time !"
