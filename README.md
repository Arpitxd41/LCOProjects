Hello there,<br>
My greetings ! I am learning to write code from iNeuron. I have joined this Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp in August of 2022. 
These set of projects were small steps to learning the DOM and have familiarity with core HTML & CSS, even though these projects seem to be trials these are my building blocks and I own this effort and desire to learn.


<br>

Currently I am working with HTML and CSS only, learning webpage structures and styling indepth. The journey of coding so far has been exciting and I am really looking forward to deploy more projects. 

<br>

*Thank-You*
