Hello there,<br>
My greetings ! I am *Arpit Tiwari* and I am learning to write code from iNeuron. I have joined this Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp in August of 2022. 

<br>

These projects in here are the assignments given by Hitesh Choudhary Sir under the programme. This is my first time coding and I am trying to get the most out of it. These assignments are non-responsive webpages and soon i'll update them with fully responsive webpages.
Currently I am working with HTML and CSS only, learning webpage structures and styling indepth. The journey of coding so far has been exciting and I am really looking forward to deploy more projects. 

<br>

*Thankyou*
