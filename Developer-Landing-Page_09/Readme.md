### Work Description :
<br>
This project is a non-responsive webpage given by my mentor to practice in HTML & CSS. Without any changes I have tried to build the same webpage using HTML & CSS purely. Majority of my work was in CSS, using various css slectors and properties to make this elegant project, use of flexbox and other styles to carefully place elements without making it long and complex I have tried not to alter it.<br> 

This one in particular took me a while to balance the elements in place and not to breaking the flow of the page. Surely after this I am confident that I can build similar pages more efficiently & on time !<br> 

This assignment is inspired by the
[Sample Webpage 9/15](./9%20Developer%20Landingpage.png ) provided by the team of ineuron.

### What I learned from Sample 9/15 :
- Navigation bar.
- Cards using flex.
- Content distribution & selection of elements.
- Border Properties and Cursor behaviour.

*Note: I expect support from my audience as i am trying to learn coding. It's very new for me, though I just had a taste of it, I am glad that I am doing it. There's a long road ahead and I have a lot to learn. <br>
Also I am open to recommendations & constructive criticism.<br>
Thankyou !*
